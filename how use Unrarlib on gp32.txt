
how use unrarlib on Gp32


first thing, please make sure you have read the license (license.txt)
the license must be in the same archive as this file.

the license said you to use unrarlib with the unrarlib license, or under the gpl
i put this 2 license in the license directory of the archive.


second thing, unrarlib use the gamepark sdk, due to Mirko sdk wasn't work on ads

third thing, unrarlib use an error function to return ... error msg
this error function is an pointer to a void function who get a 'const char *' as argument.
you must affect this function.

the original unrarlib work with memory OR disk, here it's work with the twice.
if you want load a file from memory (converted in .h or load from smc) you must create a memory_file structure,
it regroup, pointer to data, data size and an offset who are the actual pos in data.
to make it easy, i write a function who create and return a memory file stuct, from a file onto disk or in memory
	memory_file * loadMemoryFile(char * path, ulong fsize=0) ;
	
	memory_file * mfile ;	// create a pointer to a memory file struct
	mfile = loadMemoryFile("gp:\\myrar.rar") ;				// load the rar from disk into a memory_file
	mfile = loadMemoryFile(&nameOftheRARfileInAnHeaderFile, rarFileSize) ;	// load the rar from an .h

/*   list rar containing files		***/

	/* list file rar who's into memory */
	ArchiveList_struct *List = NULL ;				// declare a list
	memory_file * theRar = loadMemoryFile("gp:\\myrar.rar") ;	// create and load a memory file
	int fileNumber = urarlib_list(theRar, List);			// list the rar !
	
	/* list file rar who's onto disk */
	ArchiveList_struct *List = NULL ;			// declare a list
	int fileNumber = urarlib_list("gp:\\myrar.rar", List);	// list the rar !

	// how work list ?
	
	ArchiveList_struct *List = NULL, *lst ;
	int fileNumber = urarlib_list("gp:\\myrar.rar", List);

	lst = List ;
	lst->item.name ;	// contain first file path (path in the rar, the fileName)
	lst = lst->next   ;	// now lst point on the second file
	lst->item.name ;	// the second file path
	....

	and urarlib_freelist(List); to ...... free the list Oo

/*   get a file from the rar !	***/

 	char	*path = "falldown.fxe" ;	// path of the file we want uncompress from the rar
 	char	*data_ptr = NULL	;	// a pointer where we'll can found our uncompressed file
	ulong	  data_size	;	// a var where will be stored size of uncompressed file

	yep = urarlib_get(data_ptr, &data_size, path,"gp:\\hey.rar","password") ;			// load from disk
	yep = urarlib_get(data_ptr, &data_size, path,myPointerToAMemoryFileStruct,"password") ;	// load from memory
	
	if yep == 1 the file was loaded successfully.



so .. that's all ^^

hope this lib will be usefull :)
good dev !
